# House-Price-Prediction-Project

### Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features such as house area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, presence of amenities (like air conditioning, hot water heating, guest rooms, etc.), and proximity to a main road.

I have also built a web application that  allows users to predict house prices based on various property features using a pre-trained Support Vector Regressor (SVR) model. The app is built using Streamlit for the frontend, allowing users to input house details and receive a predicted price based on the trained model.
